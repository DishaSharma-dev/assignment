<h4>What are Commands</h4>
<p>A command is an instruction given to our computer by us to do whatever we want. In Mac OS, and Linux it is called terminal, whereas, in windows it is called command prompt. Commands are always case sensitive.</p>

<p>Commands are executed by typing in at the command line followed by pressing enter key.</p>

<p>This command further passes to the shell which reads the command and execute it. Shell is a method for the user to interact with the system. Default shell in Linux is called bash (Bourne-Again Shell)</p>
