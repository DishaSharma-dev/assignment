<p>Operating systems are there from the very first computer generation and they keep evolving with time. In this chapter, we will discuss some of the important types of operating systems which are most commonly used.</p>
<h2>Batch operating system</h2>
<p>The users of a batch operating system do not interact with the computer directly. Each user prepares his job on an off-line device like punch cards and submits it to the computer operator. To speed up processing, jobs with similar needs are batched together and run as a group. The programmers leave their programs with the operator and the operator then sorts the programs with similar requirements into batches.</p>
<p>The problems with Batch Systems are as follows &minus;</p>
<h2>Time-sharing operating systems</h2>
<p>Time-sharing is a technique which enables many people, located at various terminals, to use a particular computer system at the same time. Time-sharing or multitasking is a logical extension of multiprogramming. Processor's time which is shared among multiple users simultaneously is termed as time-sharing.</p>
<p>Disadvantages of Time-sharing operating systems are as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Problem of reliability.</li>
<li>Question of security and integrity of user programs and data.</li>
<li>Problem of data communication.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Distributed operating System</h2>
<p>Distributed systems use multiple central processors to serve multiple real-time applications and multiple users. Data processing jobs are distributed among the processors accordingly.</p>
<p>The processors communicate with one another through various communication lines (such as high-speed buses or telephone lines). These are referred as <b>loosely coupled systems</b> or distributed systems. Processors in a distributed system may vary in size and function. These processors are referred as sites, nodes, computers, and so on.</p>
<h2>Network operating System</h2>
<p>A Network Operating System runs on a server and provides the server the capability to manage data, users, groups, security, applications, and other networking functions. The primary purpose of the network operating system is to allow shared file and printer access among multiple computers in a network, typically a local area network (LAN), a private network or to other networks.</p>
<p>Examples of network operating systems include Microsoft Windows Server 2003, Microsoft Windows Server 2008, UNIX, Linux, Mac OS X, Novell NetWare, and BSD.</p>
<h2>Real Time operating System</h2>
<p>A real-time system is defined as a data processing system in which the time interval required to process and respond to inputs is so small that it controls the environment. The time taken by the system to respond to an input and display of required updated information is termed as the <b>response time</b>. So in this method, the response time is very less as compared to online processing.</p>
<p>Real-time systems are used when there are rigid time requirements on the operation of a processor or the flow of data and real-time systems can be used as a control device in a dedicated application. A real-time operating system must have well-defined, fixed time constraints, otherwise the system will fail. For example, Scientific experiments, medical imaging systems, industrial control systems, weapon systems, robots, air traffic control systems, etc.</p>
<p>There are two types of real-time operating systems.</p>
<h3>Hard real-time systems</h3>
<p>Hard real-time systems guarantee that critical tasks complete on time. In hard real-time systems, secondary storage is limited or missing and the data is stored in ROM. In these systems, virtual memory is almost never found.</p>
<h3>Soft real-time systems</h3>
<p>Soft real-time systems are less restrictive. A critical real-time task gets priority over other tasks and retains the priority until it completes. Soft real-time systems have limited utility than hard real-time systems. For example, multimedia, virtual reality, Advanced Scientific Projects like undersea exploration and planetary rovers, etc.</p>
