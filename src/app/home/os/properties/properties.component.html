<h2>Batch processing</h2>
<p>Batch processing is a technique in which an Operating System collects the programs and data together in a batch before processing starts. An operating system does the following activities related to batch processing &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>The OS defines a job which has predefined sequence of commands, programs and data as a single unit.</p></li>
<li><p>The OS keeps a number a jobs in memory and executes them without any manual information.</p></li>
<li><p>Jobs are processed in the order of submission, i.e., first come first served fashion.</p></li>
<li><p>When a job completes its execution, its memory is released and the output for the job gets copied into an output spool for later printing or processing.</p></li>
</ul> 
<h3>Advantages</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Batch processing takes much of the work of the operator to the computer.</p></li>
<li><p>Increased performance as a new job get started as soon as the previous job is finished, without any manual intervention.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Disadvantages</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li>Difficult to debug program.</li>
<li>A job could enter an infinite loop.</li>
<li>Due to lack of protection scheme, one batch job can affect pending jobs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Multitasking</h2>
<p>Multitasking is when multiple jobs are executed by the CPU simultaneously by switching between them. Switches occur so frequently that the users may interact with each program while it is running. An OS does the following activities related to multitasking &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>The user gives instructions to the operating system or to a program directly, and receives an immediate response.</p></li>
<li><p>The OS handles multitasking in the way that it can handle multiple operations/executes multiple programs at a time.</p></li>
<li><p>Multitasking Operating Systems are also known as Time-sharing systems.</p></li>
<li><p>These Operating Systems were developed to provide interactive use of a computer system at a reasonable cost.</p></li>
<li><p>A time-shared operating system uses the concept of CPU scheduling and multiprogramming to provide each user with a small portion of a time-shared CPU.</p></li>
<li><p>Each user has at least one separate program in memory.</p></li>
</ul>
