<h2>C++ What is OOP?</h2>
<p>OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.</p>

<p>Procedural programming is about writing procedures or functions that perform operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and functions.</p>

<p>Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:</p>

<ul>
<li>OOP is faster and easier to execute</li>
<li>OOP provides a clear structure for the programs</li>
<li>OOP helps to keep the C++ code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug</li>
<li>OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time</li>
</ul>
