<h2>Strings In Java</h2><br>

<p>Strings, which are widely used in Java programming, are a sequence of characters. In Java programming language, strings are treated as objects.

    The Java platform provides the String class to create and manipulate strings.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Whenever it encounters a string literal in your code, the compiler creates a String object with its value in this case, "Hello world!'.

        As with any other object, you can create String objects by using the new keyword and a constructor. The String class has 11 constructors that allow you to provide the initial value of the string using different sources, such as an array of characters.</p>
