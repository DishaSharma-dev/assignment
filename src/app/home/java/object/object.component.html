<h2>Objects in Java</h2>
<p>Let us now look deep into what are objects. If we consider the real-world, we can find many objects around us, cars, dogs, humans, etc. All these objects have a state and a behavior.</p>

<p>If we consider a dog, then its state is - name, breed, color, and the behavior is - barking, wagging the tail, running.</p>

<p>If you compare the software object with a real-world object, they have very similar characteristics</p>.

<p>Software objects also have a state and a behavior. A software object's state is stored in fields and behavior is shown via methods.</p>

<p>So in software development, methods operate on the internal state of an object and the object-to-object communication is done via methods.</p>
